# ELCA-Challenge: Bus To Green Aarhus
This is the repository for the PolyHack Hackathon 2020 of the team "bus to green aarhus"

## Files
## [main.py](main.py)
This is the normal main.py file that was provided by ELCA. It is just slightly adapted to run on other operating systems

## [random_test](random_test)
This is a little test project I created that generates random cityscapes with car and passenger traffic. This might help as a "clean" benchmark for measuring our algorithms performance.
